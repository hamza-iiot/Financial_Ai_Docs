# Dual-Mode System - Usage Examples

## Overview

This document provides concrete examples of how the dual-mode system works in practice.

---

## Example 1: Full Workflow

### Step 1: User Generates Insights (Insights Mode)

**User Action:** Clicks "Generate Financial Insights" button

**Backend Process:**
```python
# All 6 agents run with think=true (deep analysis)
insights = {
    'expense': ExpenseAgent.execute(
        query="Comprehensive expense analysis",
        mode="insights"
    ),
    'income': IncomeAgent.execute(
        query="Comprehensive income analysis",
        mode="insights"
    ),
    # ... 4 more agents
}

# Each agent takes ~50s
# Total time: ~5 minutes for all 6
```

**ExpenseAgent Insights Mode Output:**
```json
{
    "final_answer": "**Q4 2024 Expense Analysis**\n\nTotal Expenses: 468,000 SAR\n\nTop Categories:\n1. Payroll: 245,000 SAR (52.3%)\n2. Rent: 85,000 SAR (18.1%)\n3. GOSI: 38,000 SAR (8.1%)\n...",
    "thinking": {
        "reasoning": "Based on the query, I should analyze Q4 expenses. The primary focus should be on payroll and compliance costs as these are the largest. I notice GOSI payments are consistent monthly...",
        "timestamp": "2025-01-10T10:30:00"
    },
    "analysis": {
        "total_expenses": 468000,
        "categories": {
            "payroll": 245000,
            "rent": 85000,
            "government_compliance": 38000,
            ...
        }
    },
    "mode": "insights"
}
```

**Cached in Session:** All 6 agent results stored for 24 hours

---

### Step 2: User Asks Chat Questions (Chat Mode)

#### Chat Example A: Simple Question

**User Query:** "What were my top expenses?"

**Backend Process:**
```python
# Router identifies: expense agent
# Retrieve cached expense analysis
cached = session['insights']['expense']

# Generate fast response using cache
response = ExpenseAgent.execute(
    query="What were my top expenses?",
    mode="chat",
    cached_analysis=cached
)
```

**Prompt Sent to Qwen (think=false):**
```
You previously analyzed this data comprehensively:

CACHED ANALYSIS:
**Q4 2024 Expense Analysis**

Total Expenses: 468,000 SAR

Top Categories:
1. Payroll: 245,000 SAR (52.3%)
2. Rent: 85,000 SAR (18.1%)
3. GOSI: 38,000 SAR (8.1%)
...

USER QUESTION: What were my top expenses?

Answer the user's question using the cached analysis as context.
Be concise and conversational.
```

**Response (5s):**
```
Your top expenses were:

1. **Payroll** - 245,000 SAR (52% of total)
2. **Rent & Utilities** - 85,000 SAR (18%)
3. **GOSI Compliance** - 38,000 SAR (8%)

Payroll dominates your spending at just over half of all expenses.
```

**Time:** ~5-7 seconds

---

#### Chat Example B: Question Needing Fresh Search

**User Query:** "Show me all GOSI payments over 15,000 SAR"

**Backend Process:**
```python
# Router identifies: expense agent
cached = session['insights']['expense']

# Agent detects need for specific transaction search
if _needs_fresh_search("show me all GOSI"):
    additional_data = vector_store.search(
        query="GOSI payment",
        filters={'amount': {'$gte': 15000}}
    )

# Generate response with both cached context + fresh data
response = ExpenseAgent.execute(
    query="Show me all GOSI payments over 15,000 SAR",
    mode="chat",
    cached_analysis=cached
)
```

**Prompt Sent to Qwen (think=false):**
```
You previously analyzed this data comprehensively:

CACHED ANALYSIS:
Total GOSI Compliance: 38,000 SAR (8.1% of expenses)

ADDITIONAL DATA:
Transaction 1: 2024-10-15 | GOSI Monthly | 19,000 SAR
Transaction 2: 2024-11-15 | GOSI Monthly | 19,000 SAR

USER QUESTION: Show me all GOSI payments over 15,000 SAR

Answer using the cached context and additional transaction details.
```

**Response (8s):**
```
I found 2 GOSI payments over 15,000 SAR:

1. **Oct 15, 2024** - 19,000 SAR (Monthly GOSI contribution)
2. **Nov 15, 2024** - 19,000 SAR (Monthly GOSI contribution)

These are your regular employer contributions to the General Organization for Social Insurance, which total 38,000 SAR for the quarter.
```

**Time:** ~8 seconds (includes fresh search)

## Example 2: Different Agent Types

### Budget Analysis Chat

**User Query:** "How healthy is my cash flow?"

**Backend:**
```python
# Router: budget agent
cached = session['insights']['budget']

response = BudgetAgent.execute(
    query="How healthy is my cash flow?",
    mode="chat",
    cached_analysis=cached
)
```

**Cached Analysis Used:**
```json
{
    "final_answer": "Financial Health Score: 72/100\n\nNet Cash Flow: +52,000 SAR\nSavings Rate: 11.1%\nExpense Ratio: 88.9%",
    "analysis": {
        "total_income": 520000,
        "total_expenses": 468000,
        "net_cashflow": 52000,
        "health_score": 72
    }
}
```

**Response (6s):**
```
Your cash flow is **good** with a health score of 72/100.

Key points:
- You're generating a positive cash flow of 52,000 SAR
- Savings rate of 11.1% is healthy for a business
- Expense ratio at 88.9% leaves room for growth investment

Overall, your cash flow is stable and sustainable.
```

---

### Trend Analysis Chat

**User Query:** "Are my expenses increasing or decreasing?"

**Backend:**
```python
# Router: trend agent
cached = session['insights']['trend']

response = TrendAgent.execute(
    query="Are my expenses increasing or decreasing?",
    mode="chat",
    cached_analysis=cached
)
```

**Cached Analysis Used:**
```json
{
    "final_answer": "Spending Trend: Stable\n\nMonthly Change: +2,300 SAR/month (+0.5%)\n\nPattern: Expenses have remained relatively consistent with minor fluctuations due to seasonal variations.",
    "analysis": {
        "spending_direction": "stable",
        "monthly_change": 2300,
        "slope": 2.3
    }
}
```

**Response (5s):**
```
Your expenses are **stable** with only minor increases.

The trend shows a small increase of about 2,300 SAR per month (+0.5%), which is well within normal business fluctuations. No concerning upward trend detected.
```

## Example 3: Thinking Context in Final Response (Insights Mode)

### How Thinking Improves Final Response

**Query:** "Analyze my Q4 payroll expenses"

**Step 1: Thinking (think=true, 20s)**
```
Internal Reasoning:
- Time Period: Q4 (October, November, December)
- Category Focus: Payroll specifically
- Should analyze: total payroll cost, per-employee average, trends
- Consider: GOSI contributions are separate from payroll
- Currency: Present in SAR
```

**Step 2: Data Analysis**
```python
payroll_data = {
    'total': 245000,
    'transactions': 45,
    'average_per_transaction': 5444,
    'categories': {'salary': 200000, 'benefits': 45000}
}
```

**Step 3: Final Response WITH Thinking Context (think=true, 20s)**

**Prompt Sent to Qwen:**
```
User Query: Analyze my Q4 payroll expenses

Your Internal Thinking:
- Time Period: Q4 (October, November, December)
- Category Focus: Payroll specifically
- Should analyze: total payroll cost, per-employee average, trends
- Consider: GOSI contributions are separate from payroll
- Currency: Present in SAR

Analysis Results:
Total Payroll: 245,000 SAR
Transactions: 45 payments
Average per Transaction: 5,444 SAR
Breakdown: Salaries 200,000 SAR, Benefits 45,000 SAR

Provide comprehensive answer based on your thinking and analysis.
```

**Final Response:**
```
**Q4 2024 Payroll Analysis**

Your total payroll expenses for Q4 were **245,000 SAR** across 45 transactions.

**Breakdown:**
- Base Salaries: 200,000 SAR (81.6%)
- Employee Benefits: 45,000 SAR (18.4%)

**Per-Employee Cost:** Averaging 5,444 SAR per payment suggests approximately 15 employees with mixed salary levels.

**Important Note:** This excludes GOSI contributions (38,000 SAR), which are tracked separately as government compliance costs.

**Trend:** Payroll remained stable throughout Q4 with no unusual variations, indicating consistent staffing levels.
```

**Why Including Thinking Helps:**
- LLM knows to focus on Q4 specifically (from thinking)
- Remembers to exclude GOSI (from thinking)
- Provides per-employee insights (from thinking plan)
- Maintains Saudi context (from thinking)

## Example 4: Financial Statement Analysis (Financial Agents)

### Financial Agent Insights Mode (2-Call Pattern)

**User Action:** Uploads Balance Sheet, P&L, and Cash Flow Statement → Clicks "Generate Financial Insights"

**Backend Process (2 LLM calls per agent):**
```python
# All 6 financial agents run with mode="insights" using 2-call thinking pattern
financial_insights = {
    'ratio_analyst': RatioAnalystAgent.analyze_financial_statement(
        financial_data=statements,
        mode="insights"  # Triggers 2-call pattern
    ),
    'profitability': ProfitabilityAgent.analyze_financial_statement(
        financial_data=statements,
        mode="insights"
    ),
    'liquidity': LiquidityAgent.analyze_financial_statement(
        financial_data=statements,
        mode="insights"
    ),
    'financial_trend': FinancialTrendAgent.analyze_financial_statement(
        financial_data=statements,
        mode="insights"
    ),
    'risk_assessment': RiskAssessmentAgent.analyze_financial_statement(
        financial_data=statements,
        mode="insights"
    ),
    'efficiency': EfficiencyAgent.analyze_financial_statement(
        financial_data=statements,
        mode="insights"
    )
}

# Each agent takes ~100s (2 calls × 50s)
# Total time: ~10 minutes for all 6 agents
```

**What Happens Inside Each Agent (2-Call Pattern):**
```python
# CALL 1: Deep Thinking (Hidden from user)
thinking = agent._think_hidden(
    "Think deeply about liquidity metrics for this Saudi business...",
    think=True
)
# Qwen generates 10,000+ chars of reasoning
# Time: ~50 seconds

# CALL 2: Final Analysis (Using thinking as context)
response = agent.ollama.generate(
    f"""YOUR INTERNAL THINKING:
    {thinking}

    FINANCIAL DATA:
    Current Ratio: 2.34
    ...

    Using your thinking, provide comprehensive liquidity analysis.""",
    think=True
)
# Qwen generates final analysis informed by thinking
# Time: ~50 seconds
```

**LiquidityAgent Insights Mode Output:**
```json
{
    "summary": "**Liquidity & Solvency Analysis**\n\nCurrent Ratio: 2.34\nQuick Ratio: 1.87\nCash Ratio: 0.92\n\nWorking Capital: SAR 2,450,000\nCash Position: SAR 1,850,000\n\nLIQUIDITY STATUS: Excellent\n\nThe company maintains strong liquidity with current ratio above 2.0, indicating ability to cover short-term obligations comfortably...",

```

**Response (7s):**
```
Your main financial risks are **low to moderate**:

**1. Customer Concentration (Medium Risk)**
- 15% of revenue depends on one client
- Recommendation: Diversify customer base to reduce dependency

**2. FX Exposure (Low Risk)**
- 12% of costs are in USD
- Recommendation: Consider hedging if USD volatility increases

Overall risk score: 32/100 (Low Risk)

Your strong cash reserves provide good buffer against these risks.
